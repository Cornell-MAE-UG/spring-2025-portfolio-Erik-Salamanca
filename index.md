## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/IMG_0998.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Erik Salamanca, and I am a undergraduate mechinacal engineer student at Cornell University that plans on going to medical school and becoming a doctor. I entered college with a passion for engineering, but as I progressed and interacted with more people in the feild I have learned that engineering as a profession is not for me. I still hold great passion and interest in the prinicples of engineering, so I plan to finish my major while also taking the additional classes required to enter medical school. I decided I wanted to be a doctor because I want to be able to directly help people. Assiting people in their most important hour of need is what I want to dedicate my life to.
    In this feild I will also be able to pursue my passion for scienific knowledge and work with my hands. One of the biggest things 
that drew me to engineering was seeing the fruits of my labor. My favorite part of a project would be when I finished it and could see the final product working. Now I see myself doing this as a doctor, watching people come in hurt and leaving happier. That would bring me fulfillment and make everyday feel meaningfull.
